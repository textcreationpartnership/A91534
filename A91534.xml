            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I ſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other party which did very good ſervice at Wayneyard. In the mean time our horſe did gallantly, charged their foot, routed their Musketiers, and we had doubtleſſe taken moſt of them that were over the workes, but that they were preſerved by a ſtrong body of the enemies Pikes. Major <hi>Blundell</hi> and Colonell <hi>Waſhburne</hi> came in good time, charged gallantly through the thickeſt of them, which ſo terrified them, that being on all ſides beſet, they quit their ground, tumbled over the workes (beſides them they carried away) we tooke <hi>13</hi> priſon<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe happy deliverance it hath pleaſed God to give us from the cruell enemy, is I am confident, the onely news all Letters are now fild with, yet I Preſume to give you ſuch an account as I take my ſelfe obliged to, that is The Enemy about ſix of the clock this morning (as ſoone as the Ravally had beate) appeared in a full body, both horſe and foot, from Barton houſe, where it is conceived they were long before lodged, and fire being given by our Centries at the Abby guard, they preſently fell on, before our men could make any the leaſt reſiſtance, and got over the workes and drove our men from Abby-guard, and Barton bulwarke up to the maine guard, where Captaine <hi>Bagnall</hi> commanded as Captaine of the watch, (Col. <hi>Rainsboroughes</hi> Regiment being upon duty that night.) He upon their arrivall made them draw up and brought the enemy to a ſtand under the Abby-gate, where two of them were ſlaine that endeavored to break open the priſon. The alarum being generally given and received, our horſe drew out, as alſo the foot. But by this time the enemy had poſſeſt himſelfe of all the works and line from Barne-guard to the water ſide at the Abby, as alſo our magazine which I am confident they had fired h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d they not thought all their owne. Whereupon our
<pb facs="tcp:159577:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 89 -->foot made ſeverall charges upon them, ſallying through the houſes in the ſtreet, and by the Abby, and ſome of the Major Generalls Regiment threw themſelves into the little old fort over againſt the Major Generalls quarters by the high way, and from thence playd upon the enemy that were in Barne-bulwarke and at Ty-harris: ſome they ſlue, and forc't the reſt off the ground, in the mean time Major <hi>Blundell</hi> advanced with the horſe, and the Enemy drew themſelves into a compleate order, making good the paſſe, which was by a ditch with a good ſtand of Pikes, and in the meane time their musquetiers fired from their flankes. Major <hi>Blundell</hi> endeavoured to have forc't them, but was beat off three times, at the fourth, he Routed the whole party, who never came in ſo faſt as now they ran out: Three of our peices they had turned upon us and fired them, and then overthrew them, not having time either to cloy or nayle them. In the meane time our Officers did their parts. Major <hi>Blundell</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being dry beaten and bruſed, with the butt end of their muskets, but wounded in the externall part of the thigh with a Pike or Halberd ſomething largely: our Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the foot did for the moſt part gallantly, and not one Captaine of Major Generalls own Regiment, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſhot, though Captaine <hi>Preſſon,</hi> and <hi>Bagnall</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger. The field Officers did moſt gallantly. Of ours are wounded Major <hi>Blundall,</hi> who notwithſtanding never diſmounted till he had purſued the enemy within two miles of Oxford. Captaine <hi>Taylor</hi> ſhot through the body. Captaine <hi>Kellings</hi> hand all torne, Captaine <hi>Clerk</hi> ſhot in the ſide, Captaine <hi>Madox</hi> through the belly, three Lieutenants, two Quartermaſters, and ſome ſtore of Souldiers. The enemy left within and upon the workes eleven men dead, beſides what they carried off and what
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:159577:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 90 -->were wounded. The reaſon why they had no greater loſſe, was our want of ammunition upon the guards, for though we had ſtore in the Towne, there was ſcarce to be found three charges upon each guard, which much dicouraged the poore Souldiers. We took 12 or 14 priſoners, moſt of them wounded.</p>
            <p>I ſhould have told you that the enemies horſe as Major <hi>Blandell</hi> came up, Began to come through a breach they had made by the Barton-bulwarke, but by his comming were timely prevented, as alſo, that had they bin ſo wiſe as to have attempted the drawbridge they might eaſily have left in their horſe, being a great body attending with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, for the Governours man as the alarme was giving, came to open the port, and either for haſt or feare ſo left it: but it pleaſed God to direct otherwiſe, to whom be all the glory and praiſe, had not our horſe charged ſo gallantly it is doubted by all what the ſucceſſe had bin.</p>
            <p>There were of the enemy a thouſand foote, 500 wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of entred the Towne. Their horſe were about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand. The Towneſmen came forth and reſolutely aſſiſted the Souldiers, by which it appeares that the Nationall Covenant which they all tooke, and the paines the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Generall hath taken among them wrought effectually. Tis great pity theſe poore lads ſhould have their courage abated by delaying their neceſſary ſupplies,</p>
